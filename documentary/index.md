`@rqt/namecheap-web` is an API to [`namecheap.com`](https://affiliate.namecheap.com/?affId=70782) via the web interface, with an ability to log in using 2-factor Auth and check Whois.

<a href="https://github.com/artdecocode/expensive"><img src="https://raw.github.com/rqt/namecheap-web/master/images/Expensive.svg?sanitize=true" align="left"></a>The web API is currently used in the _Expensive_ package to authenticate and white-list IP addresses. This is useful for dynamic-IP holders. Because the API implemented with `gzip` compression, the amount of traffic is minimized as well, helping to save data on mobile networks.

```sh
yarn add -E @rqt/namecheap-web
```
